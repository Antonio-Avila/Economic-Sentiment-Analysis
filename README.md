# Economic Sentiment Analysis



*Initial thoughts:* When this project was initially started, there was a lot of speculation about another possible recession. It had been nearly 12 years since the Great Recession of 2008 and the United States stock markets had been (and to a lesser extent continue) enduring long bull run. Many market and economic experts began warning of a looming bubble and coupled with an escalating trade war with China, the voices of the concerned began getting louder and louder.
Little did we know at the time, a virus outbreak was occurring in the relatively unknown Chinese city of Wuhan, a virus outbreak would be the catalyst to the recession and would change the lives of people around the world.
*Goal:* The goal of this project was to see how financial news organizations were reporting at the time and determine the sentiment of the articles they were publishing.
